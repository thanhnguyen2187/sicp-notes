; We argued in Section 4.1.6 that internal definitions for block structure
; should not be considered "real" `define`s. Rather, a procedure body should be
; interpreted as if the internal variables being defined were installed as
; ordinary `lambda` variables initialized to their correct values using `set!`.
; Section 4.1.6 and Exercise 4.16 showed how to modify the metacircular
; interpreter to accomplish this by scanning out internal definitions. Modify
; the compiler to perform the same transformation before it compiles a procedure
; body.
