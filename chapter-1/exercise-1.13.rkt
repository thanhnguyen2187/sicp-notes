; Exercise 1.13
;
; Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to phi^n/sqrt(5),
; where phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2
; Hint: Let psi = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. Use induction and the definition of the
; Fibonacci numbers to prove that Fib(n) = (phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5)
;
; Solution
;
; * Prove that Fib(n) = (phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5)
; * Prove that -1/2 < psi^n < 1/2
