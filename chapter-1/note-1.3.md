# 1.3 Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures

> One of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is the
> ability to build abstractions by:
> - assigning names to common patterns and then
> - work in terms of the abstractions directly

> Often the same programming pattern will be used with a number of different
> procedures.
> 
> To express such patterns as concepts, we will need to construct procedures
> that can accept procedures as arguments or return procedures as values.
> Procedures that manipulate procedures are called _higher-order procedures_.
