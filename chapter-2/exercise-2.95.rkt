; Exercise 2.95
;
; Define P_1, P_2, and P_3 to be the polynomials
;
; P_1: x^2 - 2x + 1
; P_2: 11x^2 + 7
; P_3: 13x + 5
;
; Now define Q_1 to be the product of P_1 and P_2, and Q_2 to be the product of
; P_1 and P_3, and use `greatest-common-divisor` (Exercise 2.94) to compute the
; `GCD` of Q_1 and Q_2.
;
; Note that the answer is not the same as P_1. This example introduces
; noninteger operations into the computation, causing difficulties with the`GCD`
; algorithm. To understand what is happening, try tracing `gcd-terms` while
; computing the `GCD` or try performing the division by hand.
;
; ---
;
; P_1 * P_2 = 11x^4 ...
; P_1 * P_3 = 13x^3 ...
;
; After the first subtraction, it becomes -55/13 * x^3 + 201/13 * x^2... The
; term "error propagation" can vaguely be used here.
