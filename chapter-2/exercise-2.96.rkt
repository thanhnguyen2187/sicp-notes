; Exercise 2.96
;
; a. Implement the procedure `pseudoremainder-terms` which is just like
; `remainder-terms`, except that it multiplies the divident by integerizing
; factor described above before calling div-terms. Modify `gcd-terms` to use
; `pseudoremainder-terms`, and verify that `greatest-common-divisor` now
; produces an answer with integer coefficients on the example in Exercise 2.95.
; b. The `GCD` now has integer coefficients, but they are larger than those of
; P_1. Modify `gcd-terms` so that it removes common factors from the
; coefficients of the answer by dividing all the coefficients by their (integer)
; greatest common divisor.
