# Chapter 2: Building Abstractions with Data

> [...] key aspect of any programming language:
> - the means it provides for building abstractions by combining data objects
>   to form compound data

> Why do we want compound data in a programming language? [...]
> - elevate the conceptual level at which we can design our programs,
> - increase the modularity of our design, and to
> - enhance the expressive power of our language

> [...] isolating the parts of a program that deal with:
> - how data objects are represented [...]
> - how data objects are used
> is a powerful design methodology called data abstraction.
