# Hierarchical Data and the Closure Property

> The ability to create pairs whose elements are pairs is the essence of list
> structure's importance as a representational tool. We refer to this ability as
> the /closure property/ of `cons`.

> Closure is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us
> to create /hierarchical/ structures -- structures made up of parts, which
> themselves are made up of parts, and so on.

> The use of the word "closure" here comes from abstract algebra, where:
> - a set of elements is said to be closed under an operation,
> - if applying the operation to elements in the set produces an element that is
>   again, an element of the set.
