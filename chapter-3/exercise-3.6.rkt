; Exercise 3.6
;
; It is useful to be able to reset a random-number generator to produce a
; sequence starting from a given value.
;
; Design a new `rand` procedure that is called with an argument that is either
; the symbol `generate` or the symbol `reset` and behaves as follow:
;
; - `(rand 'generate)` produces a new random number;
; - `((rand 'reset) new-value)` resets the internal state variable to the
; designated `new-value`;
;
; Thus, by resetting the state, one can generate repeatable sequences. These are
; very handy to have when testing and debugging programs that use random
; numbers.

#lang sicp

(define (rand symbol)

  (define (generate) 0)
  (define (reset value) 0)

  (cond ((eq? symbol 'generate) (generate))
        ((eq? symbol 'reset) reset)))
