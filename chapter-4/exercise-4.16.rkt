; Exercise 4.16
;
; In this exercise we implement the method just described for interpreting
; internal definitions. We assume that the evaluator supports `let` (see
; Exercise 4.6).
;
; a. Change `lookup-variable-value` (Section 4.1.3) to signal an error if the
; value it finds is the symbol `*unassigned*`.
; b. Write a procedure `scan-out-defines` that takes a procedure body and
; returns an equivalent one that has no internal definitions, by making the
; transformation described above.
; c. Install `scan-out-defines` in the interpreter, either in `make-procedure`
; or in `procedure-body` (see Section 4.1.3). Which place is better? Why?
;
; eval -> apply-local -> procedure-body
; eval -> make-procedure
